# Portfolio
A portfolio project for Code Louisville

I am working on creating an animated front page with SVGs and either CSS or JavaScript *Work in Progress, my not be finished by project deadline* I wanted to focus first on getting the requirements for my site done before trying to incorporate something we didn't necessarily cover in class. 

My "work" page will showcase some design work that I have done throughout the years.
Incorporated a gallery slider from Bootstrap.

My "about" page is fairly straight forward bio page. *Would eventually like to incorporate some animation here as well*

My "connect page" incorporates my largest use of JS.
