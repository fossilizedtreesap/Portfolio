        <p class="me1">Hello! Thank you for stopping by and spending some time with me. I am a Georgia Peach who transplanted to the Bourbon Country for school and never left. I have a happy, little life with my dear husband and 2 cats-Schroedinger & Violet. In general I love Design, Bourbon, Dinosaurs, Fried Chicken, Star Wars, Traveling, Crafting, and Learning new things.  </p>

            <p class="me">I am a self-taught Graphic Designer and have been developing my skills for more than a decade. I was first introduced to Graphic Design in High School and just kept going with it. I have a major love for Adobe Illustrator, but am fairly familiar with the Adobe Creative Suite as a whole. I enjoy learning and developing new skills. I like to use my talents to support non-profits and other community groups, however just about every employer I have worked for has found some use of my skills.</p>
            
            <p class="me">My hope is to one day branch out to freelance design so I can move away from the traditional 9 to 5. I recently had the opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and participate in Code Louisville, a bootcamp coding program. I'm enjoying learning how to take my what I know from Graphic Design and start experimenting with the Web Design world.</p>
